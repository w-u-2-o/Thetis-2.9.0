# Snapshot of the old "sjk7" Thetis 2.9.0. GitHub Repository as of 15 May 2023

Build this and you get Steve, G7KLJ's version 2.9.0.31.

Steve has taken down his Thetis Git repository. It's not clear what Steve's plans for the future are, we'll all have to wait and see. In the meantime here is the last snapshot I have of his very valuable efforts. There are a lot of changes. You'll have to review the changelog files here but they may not be completely up to date. Everything is as it was on 15 May 2023.

### This repository is being provided **for reference only**

I'm not a developer or coder, but I can muddle my way through GitHub, mostly. Hence please don't approach me with any bugs, changes, additions, deletions, modifications, etc. I'm not equipped to act on them! This repository is being provided as a convenience to the openHPSDR community for reference only.

### Steve's original readme.md description:

An improved version of Thetis, particularly with regard to VAC latency.

My fork includes many improvements to the VAC system, and allies HL2 (Hermes-Lite 2) usage with the Apache-Labs ones.
